# Complete version

This directory contains code / an ipynb report for the abridged Rakuten Challenge. 

### Code requirements: 
The code does not require any non-standard dependencies (except maybe `nltk`). 
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
- `numpy`
- `nltk`

Please also note that I use a code formatter, `black`, that I've removed from the code because it is non-standard.

#### Installing NLTK
If you do not have NLTK installed: https://www.nltk.org/install.html. You can download individual modules in python with the command: `nltk.download('<package>')` from within python (`nltk.download('all')` will download all components). This is annoying -- I'm sorry!

### This directory contains the following files:

- `2020_06_15_Kaggle_Challenge.ipynb`: the notebook version of this report
- `util.py`: utility code to shorten this report
- `requirements.txt`: autogenerated with `conda list -e` from virtual environment for this task

### How to read through this:

The `ipynb` version of the report (hopefully) contains a streamlined narrative of this work -- it's a text/code hybrid that serves as a technical report. This report calls some utility functions from `util.py`, and so to get a better sense of what is going on, `util.py` is a good next read.
